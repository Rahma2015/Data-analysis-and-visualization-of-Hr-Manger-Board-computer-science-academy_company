# Hr-Manger-Board-computer-science-academy

This project is about HR manger board for a computer science academy company

It is a project using googlesheets

The data contains names of employees of the company , their positions, their salaries, their gender, their age.

Here I made some statistics using googlesheets formula like min salary, max salary, sum of salaries, average age and etc. 

In addition, I made some data visualization like:

-pie chart to know percentage of males vs females

-bar chart to know frequency of each age in the company
